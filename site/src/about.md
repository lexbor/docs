## Idea

Modern web contains a huge stack of technologies that underlie any modern browser. The Lexbor project is aimed at creating a browser engine in the form of a library that will provide developers with all the power of HTML to create user and server applications.
Applications can be diverse: from common HTML/CSS/Font parsers to full-featured graphic desktop/mobile programs or games.

The Lexbor library has no external dependencies, which gives complete control over the code: its portability to various systems, easy integration with applications.
