                <p>
                    You can check out the latest version of the library and our roadmap for the future <a href="roadmap/">here</a>. All development occurs on <a href="https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor">GitHub</a>.

                    <p>
                        For us, speed is an absolute must-have. 
                    <p>
                        In our development process, we focus on fastest parsing techniques for HTML, CSS, and fonts, fastest data processing methods, and fastest ways to serve content to end users. 
                    <p>
                        Whether you are building a backend that handles millions of HTML documents or a UI-heavy user app, your software’s response rate always matters to users and developers alike.

                        Lexbor’s code is optimized for ease of access in end-user applications and across programming languages. 
                    <p>
                        You can effortlessly wrap all the capabilities of the library in, say, Python to power your end-user or backend applications in a new environment. In other words, lexbor offers a feature-rich core that developers can build upon as they see fit.

                    <p>
                        Lexbor’s availability and support across various platforms and environments is a priority for us. 
                    <p>
                        When you develop with lexbor, you have zero reasons to worry about your application’s portability. Moreover, the library can be easily ported to various devices such as Smart TVs or other IoT appliances.

                        Easy-to-use, simple, comprehensible API is key to fast and safe software development. 
                    <p>
                        Lexbor’s API allows you to fine-tune a variety of HTML processing aspects, offering you the degree of flexibility you wish for in your application development.

                    In this article, I will tell you how to create a superfast HTML parser supporting DOM. We will look at the HTML specification and its disadvantages in terms of performance and resource consumption during HTML parsing.
                <p>
                    I assume the reader has a basic knowledge of HTML: tags, nodes, elements, and namespace.
