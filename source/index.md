# What is lexbor?

We build a web browser engine available as a software library; it ships under
the Apache 2.0 license and has no extra dependencies.


# What's the news?

Check out the latest version and our future roadmap [here](roadmap/) or follow
our work on [GitHub](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor).


# Our Goals

## Speed

For us, speed is an absolute must. Our development process is focused on fastest
HTML, CSS, and font parsing; fastest data processing; and fastest ways to serve
end user content.

Whether you are building a backend to serve millions of HTML documents or a
UI-heavy app, your response rates always stay our top priority.


## Integration

The code is optimized for ease of access in end-user applications, across varied
programming languages.

To put it simply, lexbor offers a feature-rich core that you can build upon as
you wish to. Need to build a Python wrapper to power your frontend or backend
apps in a new environment? No problem.


## Portability

From the very start, we focus on availability and support in vastly different
environments.

When you use lexbor, you need not worry about your app's portability; from the
ground up, we designed lexbor for wide support across various computing
platforms and IoT devices.


## Clarity

An easy-to-use, simple, comprehensible API is our key to fast and safe software
development.

Offering you a degree of flexibility you always wished for, lexbor's API enables
fine-tuning HTML processing just the way you want it.


# Articles

In this article series, I will tell you how to create a superfast HTML parser
supporting DOM, eventually taking you to a full-fledged web browser. We will
look at the HTML specification and its disadvantages in terms of performance and
resource consumption during HTML parsing.

I assume you have a basic knowledge of HTML: tags, nodes, elements, and
namespaces.

# Examples

The code for all examples is available in our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/lexbor/lexbor/tree/master/examples/lexbor). We
also discuss some of them in extra detail to provide insights into `lexbor`
usage:
